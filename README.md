# Midnight-Waffle

#Hello, Welcome to the Midnight Waffles Github Page.
-This game is based on Mark Reiter, who runs the Code Day Chicago event, and his awesome Waffle making skills. He makes his waffles beautifully and he makes them at Midnight.

#Designing the Game
-The game was created singlehandedly by me, TheExcepitionist, using Java. The characters, and enemies, were created by Pawel(a guy) and me using Photo Shop and Piskel(http://www.piskelapp.com/). It took a lot (48 hours) of time to think of ideas needed to make it a quality game (What I think is) with a lot of (not implemented yet) items, power ups, and power downs. We had a team of 6, but only 3 people did anything. Those 3 people did a doing a different part of the Project. Sometimes 1 person worked on one part, but then went back to doing their own thing to help the project(never happen), again.
